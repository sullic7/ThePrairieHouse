          <h2>PERFECT WEDDING GROUP, LAKE VILLA, ILLINOIS</h2>
          <h3>Aug 24, 2009</h3>
          <p>Everything there was wonderful - from the house, to the garden, to the lake.<span class="toggle-show-hide initial-hide"> We had our small wedding there. It was the perfect setting with the yard, lake and the prairie flowers.  Laurie and Larry were so helpful in making the stay &amp; the wedding perfect. The house was great for the wedding.  We had plenty of room for everyone at the wedding and the BBQ the next day.  Including the people who stayed at the house with us.  We used the backyard and set up a tent.  The pergola in the back was a perfect backdrop. The sights were amazing.  We watched the hummingbirds up close every morning as we ate breakfast, the eagles soaring above us and the chipmunks scurrying about the yard. The kayaks, canoe and rowboat was great for us to use.  We took the kayaks out by the eagle island. That was really amazing. What else can I say. . .We had the most amazing time and would definitely recommend this to anyone.”</span></p>

          <h2>CONRAD FAMILY FROM OH, IN, WI, NC</h2>
          <h3>Aug 2, 2009</h3>
          <p>Great family time with three generations - Grandma will be 98 next month!
            We enjoyed “talking” with a pair of Barred owls and watching all the other birds, including the Eagles.  The Prairie flowers were in full bloom.   Great time!</p>

          <h2>TWO CHICKS AND A ROOSTER LLC QUILTERS, FROM WI </h2>
          <h3>Feb 28, 2009</h3>
          <p>What a beautiful place! <span class="initial-hide toggle-show-hide">We held our Quilting Retreat here - 8 ladies all at sewing machines cutting and making quilts.  While we ate dinner on Saturday night 5 deer decided to join us (outside)  to have their dinner too.  The weather was cold, but  inside we were warm and toasty. We leave today with mixed  emotions - sad at having to leave this amazing place and happy to have had the opportunity to spend the weekend here with our fellow quilters.</span></p>

          <h2>BOB AND BONNIE HOLIDAY RETREAT FROM IL, MO, WA</h2>
          <h3>November 26</h3>
          <p>We have a lot to be grateful for and we were thankful to bring our entire family to the Prairie House for Thanksgiving 2008. <span class="initial-hide toggle-show-hide">We made memories here once before in 2006 for Dad's 60th birthday and decided to return to make even more memories.  The owners provided Thanksgiving linens and personal decorations for our event.  It is incredibly warm here.  It is cozy with the fireplace and all the toys and puzzles and games, not to mention ping pong and billiards and a grand piano.  Between eating in the gourmet kitchen to playing with our family, it was wonderful.  More memories made - fond and warm.  We were even able to take a hike on the property in the snow - enjoying the solitude and the beauty of the area.  Our grandkids loved the treehouse.  We highly recommend this property to anyone with families or even a romantic getaway.  We'll be back!</span>

          <span class="initial-hide toggle-show-hide">The Schweitzer Family celebrated Dad’s 60th birthday here &amp; it was PERFECT!  What a warm, beautiful Prairie/Lake House.  We made many memories here and had so much to do – ping pong, billiards, ball games, kayaking, canoeing, rowing, fishing, bird (eagle) watching, hiking, eating, playing, and a campfire.  Thanks for sharing your home with us!</span></p>

          <h2>FAMILY GATHERING FROM IL AND MI</h2>
          <h3>August 15, 2008</h3>
          <p>What can we say?  The serenity of this place has helped us slow down, and catch our breath. <span class = "toggle-show-hide pics initial-hide"> The prairie, the woods, and the lake are beautiful!
            We saw a red-tailed hawk right outside the window at breakfast, and enjoyed watching the eagles.  The house is so well designed and comfortable.  Thanks, Larry and Laurie, for answering our many questions.  The gardens were lovely and we loved the reading nook.</span></p>

          <h3>The Prairie</h3>
          <p>
            Nature lovers and prairie enthusiasts will love this modern prairie style home built to complement its magnificent surroundings:
          </p>
          <p>18 acres of prairie surround the house</p>
          <p>
            65 native flower species and 7 grasses provide a dynamic collage of color for three seasons.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enjoy a stroll through the prairie or the 14-acre oak/hickory woods where guests enjoy catching a glimpse of the local wildlife such as deer, fox, red-tailed hawk, owl, bald eagle, and ring-necked pheasant.  Mid-summer is the peak prairie flowering time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fresh cut flowers from the garden grace the rooms.  Volleyball and lawn games are provided for the spacious backyard, and binoculars and a spotting scope are available for wildlife viewing.

          </p>
          <p>
            The pier and boat shed are a 5 minute stroll behind the garden on a wide mowed path that winds along the edge of the prairie and lake.

          <p>
            Just upstream from Lake Sinissippi on the Rock River, is Horicon National Wildlife Refuge where over 200 species of birds have been documented, making it an attractive destination for birders and nature photographers.
